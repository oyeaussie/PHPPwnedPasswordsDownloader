<h2>Description:</h2>
PHPPwnedPasswordsDownloader is a tool to download pwned password hash files from HaveIBeenPwned API.

The hash files can be sorted, indexed and cached to perform faster look ups of pwned password. The tool also has a CLI lookup tool to check if the entered password or hash is in the pwned passwords hash files.

This tool is written in PHP so, it can be either run from the CLI or integrated into any site you want by instantiating the classes.
